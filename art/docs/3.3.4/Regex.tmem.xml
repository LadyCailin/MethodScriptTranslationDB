	<key><![CDATA[MethodScript uses Java style regexes, so in general, any regex guides you find online for Java will apply to  MethodScript as well, with the obvious caveat that the actual functions used in Java will vary. Regex is a non-trivial  subject, and entire websites have been dedicated to it, so it is not in the scope of this wiki to cover it. For further  reading, [%s see this website]. A "test harness" script is also provided with the  [[%s|installable Local Packages]]. The package to install is  "RegexTestHarness".]]></key>
