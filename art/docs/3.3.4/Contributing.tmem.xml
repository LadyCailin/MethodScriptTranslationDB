	<key><![CDATA[If you intend on submitting code changes, you'll need a fork of the project. You can create a fork on github, and then  clone from there. Don't worry, if you clone directly from the main repo (which you won't have commit access to) you can  easily create a fork later, and point the remote to there instead. The main repo is read only, so if you only want to  build and make changes locally, it is ok to just use the main repo's access url. The access url can be found on the  project's github page at the top, and looks like %sgit@github.com:user/project.git%s. This is the address  you'll need. If you don't have a public/private key set up with github, or you don't have a github account at all  (you'll need one to contribute, though not to simply pull), you'll need the http url instead:  %s and will have to enter your password (or leave it blank for anonymous  access). This url will vary depending on whether or not you are checking out from the main project, or your own fork.  Click next. You'll probably want to start off with the "master" branch, though you can select any other branches you  want too. If you don't get a particular branch right now, that's ok, you can get them later. Set the destination  directory (probably ~/NetBeansProjects) and project name, then click finish. It will ask if you want to open the project  afterwards. Since CommandHelper is a maven project, it will identify it properly without any extra requirements, so go  ahead and open it at this time.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[CommandHelper uses [%s git] and [%s maven] for source  control and build system, respectively. If you need to do more advanced things with the project, you'll need to download  these tools separately and use them from the command line. Follow the directions to download and install them. If you  can run %sgit --version%s and %smvn --version%s from the command line, you have successfully set them  up. It is assumed that you know the basics of [%s git] and  [%s maven], and so topics like commiting and pulling won't be addressed.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[If you wish to contribute code to CommandHelper, first of all, thank you! CommandHelper has grown into a very large  project, and the user base is expanding faster than a single person can develop for. While there are many ways to  actually write code, this article outlines the only "officially supported" workflow. You'll need knowledge of a few  tools, and a good command of Java to get started though, and so many concepts may be beyond the scope of this article.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Building from the command line is equally simple. Run %smvn install%s to do the equivalent of the "Build"  option in NetBeans, or %smvn clean install%s to clean and build. If you need to set the build profile, use the  -P option, so %smvn -Pprovisional-build clean install%s for instance. You can also use the other targets, such  as %spackage%s to create a release zip, which can't be done from NetBeans.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[To submit a PR, you must have created a fork, and set up a remote for your fork. NetBeans 7.3 allows for all of this to  be done from directly inside the GUI, but previous versions required the command line to do some of these things. First,  you'll want to make sure that your code is up-to-date against the "upstream" repo, that is, the main repository. Finish  all your changes, and commit them to your local repo. Then, pull from the upstream repo to ensure the commit can be  cleanly merged (fix any conflict should they arise) and then push to your fork. Once you have pushed, go to your fork in  github and click Pull Request. Enter a description of the PR, and submit. Once submitted, you can continue to update  this branch, and the new commits will be reflected in the existing PR, however, adding more commits may slow the time it  takes to process your PR, so it is a good idea to create a branch and work on that if you need to continue working while  the PR is being reviewed.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[First, you must add the upstream repo as a remote. To add a remote, run %sgit remote add NAME ACCESS_URL%s The  name can be whatever you like (maybe "upstream" is a good choice) and the access url is the url of the repo you forked  from. From that point on, you can run %sgit pull upstream master%s to pull from the master branch of the  upstream repository. You will not be able to push to CommandHelper's main repository, but in general to do so you would  run %sgit push upstream master%s.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[When submitting a PR, you may have to rebase. If you have several commits, and they are all logically a part of the same  code change, and they haven't yet been reviewed, you'll want to ''rebase'' your commits.  [%s This article] goes in depth about how to  squash your commits, but the gist is this: If you have 4 commits that you need to rebase, then you would run  %sgit rebase -i HEAD~4%s to combine the previous 4 commits. If the commit has been reviewed, do NOT rebase at  that point, because then the reviewer will have to look at the entire diff again, instead of just looking at the diff  from the last time they reviewed the changes. Additionally, if you have several logically separate code changes, it is  ok to have them remain separate commits, and is in fact encouraged, so they can selectively be reverted if need be.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Due to the shear size of CommandHelper, it may not be a good starting point for someone that is wishing to get into open  source development. However, with dedication, patience, and some critical thinking, you'll definitely be able to  contribute. The code in CommandHelper is fairly well organized, follows good  [%s software engineering design patterns], is unit tested, abstracted,  and is generally geared towards long term stability and maintainability. Generally speaking, it is not important to  fully understand the entirety of the code base before working on it, but you'll need to understand the  [[%s|Basic Architecture]] before you'll be able to understand where to even begin. The  purpose of this article is not to help you understand how to add code to the project, but instead is meant to help you  get set up and building the code locally.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[To build the project in NetBeans, right click the project, and select "Build". If you have just switched branches, or  something else if going wrong with the build, select "Clean and Build" instead. Cleaning the project clears out all  compiled files, and recompiles all sources, but is otherwise the same as a normal build. Notice on the top toolbar,  there is a dropdown box that says &lt;default config&gt;. Among possible choices, there will be the "provisional-build"  option, which is provided to maven by CommandHelper's pom file. This ''build profile'' causes maven to skip tests, which  is useful if you are constantly rebuilding during development, or there are failing tests preventing you from actually  compiling a binary. You may select that build profile before building, if desired. Note though that you should build in  the default config before committing, to make sure that none of the unit tests fail on your code.]]></key>

NetBeans comes integrated with all the  tools we normally need to do things with CommandHelper, but you may want to look at the Advanced Tools section below if  you have to do more advanced things from the command line.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Building the project is equally straightforward, since it uses maven. Maven manages downloading all dependencies, which  are specified in the pom, automatically. The first time you build the project it will take a very long time, because it  must initially download all the dependencies, which for a completely clean install will be a very large number. You must  be connected to the internet for the initial build, but the dependencies are all cached on your system, so future builds  won't take nearly as long, and won't require a network connection.]]></key>
