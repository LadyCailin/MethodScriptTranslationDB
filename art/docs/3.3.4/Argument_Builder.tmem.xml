	<key><![CDATA[Some methods may have entirely different signatures, and simply having optional arguments and type unions isn't enough to express the differences. In these cases, using multiple signatures is appropriate. By default, one signature is assumed. Multiple signatures must be distinguishable between each other.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[There are 2 methods to implement in the function to provide support. If a function wishes to provide support for this mechanism, then the returnType and arguments methods should be implemented. By default, AbstractFunction implements these methods and overrides them with default implementations, so functions aren't automatically opted in. The core object in the argument system is the Argument class. An Argument is a descriptor that describes an argument in detail, including its name, its type, and a description of the argument, as well as any other information about the object, such as if it is a vararg, the default parameter, etc. There are various builder methods available to more concisely write out the information.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Despite the no-confliction requirement, there will only be as many signatures as are defined. The signature that is ultimately selected will have all optional values filled in with their defaults if not provided by the user, so the signature selection process is fully opaque to the function. The signature that was matched can be determined by the function.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[There are three algorithms here at work. Firstly, determining if a function is allowed to register the given signatures (signature validation), and if not, causing an error at the level of the function definition. Secondly,  at script compile time, determining if the call to the function is correct (compile checks).  Finally, at runtime, we determine which signature was called, fill in the optional parameters with the defaults (if required), and executing the function (argument parsing).  Eventually, the third step will be rolled into compile time where possible.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[This situation is however, allowed only if the conflict happens with optional values. If multiple signatures are conflicting, then this is an error with the function definition, and is reported as such. For instance, if the function registers two signatures: f(a) and f(a...), this is an error, and the function is not allowed to register these two signatures.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Signatures must not overlap. This can unintentially happen when optional arguments (and varargs) are used. Signatures with optional arguments are actually considered as permutations of themselves, so f(a, [b], [c]) actually has 4 permutations: f(a, b, c), f(a, b), f(a, c) and f(a). The number of permutations of a method is n ** n, where n is the number of optional arguments. Some argument combinations can cause some permutations to be ambiguous. This is allowed, however, it can create a situation where the user appears to be able to use a signature with various combinations of arguments, but they are in reality not. Consider the case of f([B b1], [B b2]). There are 4 permutations here: f(), f(B b1), f(B b2), f(B b1, B b2). f(B b1) and f(B b2) cannot be distinguished between each other by types alone, so the user cannot call the function with f(b), as we cannot determine if they mean to call f(b1) or f(b2). f() and f(b, b) are still acceptable. Thus, in this case, we signal to the user that only a call to f(b) is an error. The other, non-ambiguous signatures are allowed.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[If the signatures have different number of arguments, we know they do not conflict, and we can continue. If they have the same number of arguments, then we need to consider each argument, one at a time. If any of the arguments have different types, we can continue, as they do not match. However, this is a bit tricky, because each argument must be shown to be disjoint types. If B extends A, the f(B) and f(A) are ambiguous signatures, because calling f(B) could possibly match either type. Thus, each argument is considered to match if either of the arguments in a given position can be cast to the other. (This is more complicated, but the same general principal with type unions.) Note that classes with different generics are considered different types. So array&lt;A&gt; is disjoint with array&lt;B&gt;. However, when using type wildcards, this can get much more complicated, so if B extends A, then array&lt;? extends A&gt; and array&lt;B&gt; are not disjoint.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[At runtime, we again check against the signature list to find the correct signature. Once again, if we cannot find the signature, we throw an error, though this time it is a runtime exception, not a compile error. The only difference is that this time we WILL find the correct signature, because there will be no auto values anymore, only real, runtime values, which are of course always of a concrete type. Once the signature is found, we call the function as normal.]]></key>

As a broad overview, the following features are supported: Type safety for functions, and automatic detection and handling of CastExceptions, upward type safety (functions provide their return type), support for varargs, support for functions with multiple signatures, support for functions with generic types (though this is not yet supported by the rest of the system, functions can declare their support, which will be reflected in the documentation,  and it will be phased in in the future), type unions, and support for optional parameters with default.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[At compile time, checks are done against the user's code to ensure that ensure that the values sent to the functions are of the appropriate type. This validation is considerably easier than the validation of the signatures. Given a function with a certain set of arguments, first, signatures that don't match the correct size are  eliminated. (Not eliminating signatures that have varargs.) Next, each signature is matched one by one, until one is found that matches. If there are none that match, this is a compile error. Compilation is stopped, and the errors are reported to the user. Assuming the validation passes, these results are not used; it is merely meant to rule out the possibility of some errors. Additionally, values of type auto are essentially wildcards. We must assume that they will be of a correct type at runtime. There are still some checks that can be done at compile time, even with only auto values being passed in. Namely, if there are no varargs and there are no signatures that match the argument count given. But by and large, auto values cannot be checked. As long as there is at least one signature that could potentially match, we will allow compilation to continue.]]></key>
