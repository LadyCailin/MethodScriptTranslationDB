	<key><![CDATA[The main difference between MethodScript being run from CH scripts and running on your system is that Minecraft specific  functions will not work. All other functions will work, or at least attempt to work just the same. To facilitate  commandline usage, a few extra features have been added, namely the sys_out, sys_err, and exit functions. These  functions will not be quite as useful in game, but will still work to some extent. Additionally, command line parameters  can be sent to your script, and those are placed into the @arguments variable, which is defined before your script runs,  as an array, as well as the $ vars, which will be populated from $1 - $[x] where the number is the position of the  variable on the command line. $, the final var, is also defined, and it contains all the arguments passed in,  concatenated together. $0 is a specially defined variable, and is the same as Bash's $0 variable, which is the path that  this script was executed with. Due to its less often usage, it is excluded from @arguments and $.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Many of the features MethodScript offers are valid to be used from the command line. As more and more features are  added, the potential for MethodScript to be a scripting language used throughout your system, even for non-minecraft  related things, increases. To this end, MethodScript now has all the basic capabilities needed to write scripts from the  command line.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Finally, you may execute a MethodScript file on unix systems by executing it directly. To do so, be sure to put  %s#!/usr/bin/env /usr/local/bin/mscript%s at the top of your file, then set the file's execution bit,  using %schmod +x %s. Then, you may simply run %s./script.ms%s (assuming the filename is  script.ms). Using the cmdline tool "new" you can create a blank file with the file set up correctly.  [[%s|See this page]]]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[All functions work basically the same, minor differences may exist, but they are noted in the documentation. The glaring  exception to this is that calls to Minecraft functions will not work at all, and in fact, may simple error out by  throwing a stack trace or something. This is not a bug per-se, you must simply not use those functions.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[To install MethodScript on your system, download the CommandHelper jar, and place it in a sensible location. If you are  already running a Minecraft server with CommandHelper installed, the jar file there will suffice, though you may wish to  place a copy of it elsewhere, as otherwise your persistence databases and settings will be combined. (Keep in mind that  using serialized persistence is NOT thread safe, and so you run the risk of corrupting your database by having two  instances of CH running at once, if they are both writing to the persistence db.)]]></key>
