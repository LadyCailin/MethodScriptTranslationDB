	<key><![CDATA[A client request to the master server simply requests the port that the slave server is on. This is required, since the request may come in from an outside host, that wouldn't have access to the file system. The master server looks up the requested server in the registry, reports the port, and kills the socket.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[The first thing that should be sent is the entire script. It may be pre-compiled and optimized, or not, but the server will first compile the script locally, and verify that it does in fact compile. If the script did compile successfully, the server will respond with the string "SCRIPT OK". If the script did not compile, it will respond with the string "COMPILE ERROR", followed by the string error message that describes the compile error, at which point the server will then again be listening for a command. If the script was ok, the client should then send the variable list, serialized as a json string. The values in the variables should be serialized using the standard construct serialization mechanism. The server will then build the appropriate data structures from the data, and execute the script on that system. If an exception was generated during execution of the script, the server will respond with the string "EXCEPTION", followed by the json string exception object, which will be the serialized form of the exception. If no exception was generated, then the string "OK" will be written, followed by the json construct serialization of the return value of the construct. If the construct did not return anything, or returned %s, an empty string is written.]]></key>

There are several steps required to set up a connection, but once the connection is established, making requests to the server is fairly straightforward.

The script to be executed has two parts, the variable list, and the script itself. The script is sent first, since it may cause a compile error, and if so, there is no point in sending the variable list.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Each slave server should regularly check that the master port is bound to, and if not, it should spin up a master server in addition to the slave server it is already running. This can be done in the heartbeat thread for the slave server. Each slave server is responsible for picking a random unused port (usually between   and ), and then registering that information with the file system. In standard MethodScript servers, this will be the Persistence Network's registry, using the "federation.**" namespace. It is assumed that the administrator will keep all server instances pointed to the same registry. The registry contains information about each slave server, including the server name, the slave port it is listening on, and a "last_updated" timestamp, which if expires, %ss the entry. The heartbeat thread, in addition to checking for the master server, should update this timestamp on a regular basis.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[In addition, servers may require a password. This password must be shared between the client and the server, and adds a small amount of additional security, though it is highly recommended that PKI be used instead of simply a password, as the password can be easily obtained by a man in the middle. If MitM attacks are not a concern, a secure password is a valid way to secure the server, however. The password may be used in addition or instead of PKI.]]></key>

The server will determine if one of the authorized keys can decrypt this array properly, and if so, the connection will proceed, and the server will write the string "AUTHENTICATION OK". If not, the server will write the string "AUTHENTICATION BAD" followed by the string error message. If the server does not require PKI authentication, then the client should write an empty byte array, and the server will reply with "AUTHENTICATION OK".]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Connections to the slave servers are secured both ways. The client ensures it is connecting to the correct server (though this is admittedly slightly less important), and the server ensures that the client is allowed to connect to it. The client must provide the server's public key, and its private key. The slave server connection must provide a list of authorized keys, and its private key. This data is used to secure the connection both ways. If the server or client requires secure connections, then the other must also use secured connections.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[The master server is a random process on the machine that listens to the master port, and gives out server routing information to requesting processes. This setup works much like a dynamic DNS system. The master server is established by the first process to realize that there is no other process listening on the master port. The protocol it follows is different than the slave servers. Since connections are potentially long running, and we don't want to depend on the master server remaining up for other connections, a client first makes a request to the master server for the port that it should connect to, and then it disconnects from the master server, and initializes a new connection to the correct slave server.]]></key>

	<key><![CDATA[Connections to the master server are secured differently than the connections to the slave server -- though the administrator may choose to use the same keys for both. If connections to the master servers are secured, all master servers must use the same private key. This is akin to DNSSEC system. Master server connections are authenticated only one way. The client knows it is connecting to the proper master server, but the master server does not care what servers connect to it. When allowing a connection, servers must provide the master server private key, if they are intending on requiring secure master server requests. When making a connection to the host, the client should provide the public key for master server requests. If the master server provides the private key, the client is required to provide the public key of the server.]]></key>

The authentication to the server (the two way authentication) and the password, if provided, is handled using the application logic.]]></key>
